        <h1>PROJECT:</h1>
        <p>
            Design a small-scale e-commerce site/blog for vintage and 
            antique items.
        </p>
        <h2>TEAM:</h2>
        <p>
            I was the sole designer for this job. My designs were created on Figma and were then given to a front-end developer to implement.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p2-challenges">CHALLENGES:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create an easy-to-understand e-commerce site for shoppers.</li>
            <li>Allow users to learn about the products for sale. </li>
            <li>Establish a brand as well as create a logo design.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>RESEARCH:</h2>
        <p>
            I first researched large e-commerce sites such as Amazon, Ebay, and Etsy. However, in order to create a simple, small-scale e-commerce site I decided that I needed to look at sites that were geared towards selling vintage and antique items specifically. At this point I researched sites like Ruby Lane and Tara Shaw. After understanding the vintage/antique sale space as well as incorporating what the client wanted to provide users, I decided that the site would not only be a place to sell items, but also a blog to allow users to learn more about the item and how it was obtained.  
        </p>    
        <h2>SOLUTIONS:</h2>
        <h3 class="challenge">Challenge 1: Easy-to-understand E-Commerce Site</h3>
        <p>
            After my initial research, I had to determine what would give the user a simple and enjoyable approach to finding items. I decided that the homepage would be divided into two sections: ‘New Arrivals’ and ‘Featured Products’ sections.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> 
                The ‘New Arrivals’ section would feature any new items for sale. This would change regularly, keeping the user interested in returning to the site to see new items featured. 
                   </li>
            <li>
                ‘Featured Products’ would be categories of items the client wants to highglight for some time. Users can click on a category they are interested in and see all the products within that category.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="p3-img-container">
            <img class="research-img p3-img" src="img/landing-page.png" alt="landing page interface">
        </div>
        <h3 class="challenge">Challenge 2: Quick Access to Information </h3>
        <p>
            I wanted the user to have access to information quickly without having to navigate through the site too much. I implemented an overlay on the items which will present the user with a quick overview of the product’s information on hover.
        </p>
        <div class="p3-img-container p3-2nd-img">
           <img class="research-img" src="img/overlay.png" alt="image with text overlay"> 
        </div>
        
        <h3 class="challenge p3-challenge-3">Challenge 3: Establish a Brand</h3>
        <p>
            The client tasked me with creating a logo and brand for their site. They provided me with a photo of a flower that inspired the name of the site as a guide for the brand of the site.
        </p>
        <div class="p3-img-container flower-container">
            <img class="research-img p3-img flower" src="img/cloth-flower.png" alt="image with text overlay">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            I created a flower using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. I decided to make the flower look like a paper cutout because I wanted it to look like a cherished item that was saved in scrapbook.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The flower has a cardstock look with paper grains.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is a white edge on the rim of the flower to give the effect that it is a cutout.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="flower-container">
            <img class="flower" src="img/paper-flower.png" alt="red paper flower logo">   
        </div>
        <p>
            When creating the logo, I wanted the font to look like an antique style font. I wanted the letters to be easy to read and would flow well with the flower design. The swash of the K serves as a stem for the flower to tie the logo together.
        </p>
        <div class="knacks-img-container">
            <img class="research-img p3-img" src="img/knacks-logo.png" alt="More Knickknacks text with logo">
        </div>
        <h2>REFLECTIONS: </h2>
        <p>
            As my first job, the experience is priceless.  
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I learned the importance of communicating the design process to clients in order to end up with a successful website. Fully clarifying my design process and maintaining communication throughout the project will result in satisfied clients, and less work as the project progresses. 
            </li>
            <li>
                I thoroughly enjoyed the creative side of this job. Creating a logo in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop was fun and allowed me to hone my personal creativity.
            </li>
            <li>
                Typography is a topic of continued interest and I was able to use my knowledge of typography to choose fonts that fit the look of the site.
            </li>
        </ul>
