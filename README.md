# UI-UX Designer Portfolio

I built this website according to provided Figma style-guides and prototypes. I used a mobile first approach and built responsive pages, using CSS Flexbox and Grid, which function on all screen sizes. I always strive to utilize semantically accurate HTML to assist search engines, screen readers, and other user devices determine the significance and context of my coded content. I continue to maintain and update this website upon request.

I manipulated the DOM using JavaScript to create features such as "animated on-click" navigation buttons, drop-down menus, and toggle effects that open and close various features. For instance, when the "hamburger button" is pressed it transforms into an X and transitions back when pressed again. In addition, when the navigation menu slides into view from the right side of the screen, a sleek tinted overlay covers the content under the menu. Clicking either the hamburger button or the overlay will collapse the menu. Creating smooth and visually pleasing user experiences is always a fun challenge and I endeavor to deliver a satisfying final product.
