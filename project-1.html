        <h1>CHALLENGE:</h1>
        <p>
            World Citizen is a humanitarian organization with a vision to help people who are suffering and provide them with needed supplies. 
            After a detailed analysis of the competitive landscape, the founders of World Citizen have decided to create an online clothing donation platform. 
            The goal is that anyone can donate clothes easily. 
        </p>
        <h2>SOLUTION:</h2>
        <p>
            An interface that visually presents relevant options to personalize the user experience, saving time spent searching.
        </p>
        <h2>TEAM:</h2>
        <p>
            This was a solo project as an assignment for Phase 1 of Reskill Americans bootcamp. 
            I was heavily involved in the end-to-end design process which included user research, designing the screens, prototyping, and usability testing. 
        </p>
        <h2>RESEARCH:</h2>
        <p>
            The first step in the project was to learn more about the enterprise of clothes donations. 
            I researched, analyzed, and compared how charities and for-profit organizations operate the clothes donation business. 
            After understanding the space, I turned my attention to the target users of the app. 
            I wanted to understand how users donate clothes and what would help make the process easier. 
            For research, I conducted live interviews via Zoom. 
            The participants were adults with busy lifestyles from both urban and suburban areas.<br>
        </p>    
        <p class="touching-p">
            Through research, I found that user needs consisted of: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Convenience</li>
            <li>Transparency of donations</li>
        </ul>
        <img class="research-img notes-first-img notes-img" src="img/research.png" alt="research notes">
        <p class="section-space">
            I also learned some common user behavior:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Companies/organizations are accessed primarily through mobile.</li>
            <li>Phones have surpassed desktop usage.</li>
            <li>Users have a preference for focused and personalized apps.</li>
        </ul>
        <img class="research-img notes-img" src="img/research-2.png" alt="research notes on what people think, say, feel, and do.">
        <h2>USER FLOW:</h2>
        <p>
            Before diving into specific designs, I created a user flow to help me visualize the main screens and features.   
        </p>
        <img class="research-img" src="img/user-flow.png" alt="flow chart detailing sign-up and scheduling donation pickups">
        <h2>LOW FIDELITY:</h2>
        <p>
            Once I knew how the main screens would be, I focused on a couple of the key screens.<br>
            Here are some of the initial concepts:
        </p>
        <img class="research-img" src="img/low-fidelity.png" alt="low fidelity mobile user interface sketch.">
        <h2>HIGH FIDELITY:</h2>
        <p>
            Here are some high fidelity mockups.
        </p>
        <img class="research-img" src="img/high-fidelity.png" alt="finished user interface">
        <p>Once the designs matured enough, I used Figma to create interactive protypes so users can have a more realistic feel when testing the app.</p>
        <h2>REFLECTIONS:</h2>
        <p>As my first assignment, what I learned was invaluable.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I learned that I thoroughly enjoy prototyping. I have continued my learning in order to be able to produce as realistic a prototype as possible before it is sent to the development team. </li>
            <li>Coming up with meaningful user interview questions was challenging at first. After my first interview I realized that some changes were necessary to get better information to produce a design that users would enjoy to use.</li>
            <li> I learned that I truly have a genuine interest in design and that was my biggest motivation. The end-to-end process of this project was extensive but the desire to learn and create a great product was very motivating. I look forward to revisiting this project once I have more experience under my belt.</li>
